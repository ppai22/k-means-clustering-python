# K-Means Clustering implemented using Python
Test script that performs K-Means clustering of given data set using Python without using frameworks

## Dependencies:
- Python modules: numpy, random
- Python version: 3.7.4

Inputs required:
- data_set: Input data set in given format as demonstrated in the code
- k_value: No of clusters needed
- precision: The precision with which calculations have to be made

## Further improvements:
- Code is slow for huge data sets. Need to optimize.
- Need to compare with same data set run on frame work such scikitlearn and compare the results
